# Challenge-2

In this challenge, I aimed for a minimal and basic style for a portfolio page. The page includes sections for Home, About, Services, Portfolio, and a Contact section. The "About Me" section contains an image of myself along with a short paragraph describing my skills, experience, education, and other interests. In the future, I plan to use the "My Services" tab to provide a brief summary of the services I offer. I've utilized a few placeholder icons and added information about a few services. Within the "My Work" section, I've included placeholder images, including an image of the current page. Hovering over an image triggers a smooth transition using a gradient effect from bottom to top, creating a subtle animation. Clicking on the image reveals a brief description of the work and a link icon that navigates to the specific page. Moving on to the "Contact Me" section, I've included options to download my resume, view my social media profiles, and leave a message. When the page is resized, a navigation bar appears on the right side of the screen. Users can exit by clicking on the 'X' icon. There's also a menu icon at the top right to re-enter the navigation bar. At 600px, the page switches to a format optimized for viewing on mobile phones.
